# Wine Clustering Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis and a clustering study on a wine dataset using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to discover natural groupings within the data based on chemical composition, without any prior knowledge of the wine types.

## Dataset
This dataset is an adapted version of the well-known **Wine Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains the results of a chemical analysis of 178 wines grown in the same region in Italy. The original dataset included information on three different cultivars, but this version has been modified for an unsupervised learning task by removing the class labels.

The 13 chemical attributes of the dataset include:
* Alcohol
* Malic acid
* Ash
* Alcalinity of ash
* Magnesium
* Total phenols
* Flavanoids
* Nonflavanoid phenols
* Proanthocyanins
* Color intensity
* Hue
* OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
* Proline
